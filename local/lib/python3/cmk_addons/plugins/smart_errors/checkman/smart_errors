title: SMART: Error Counter Monitoring

description:
 This check monitors SMART error counters on storage devices that support
 SCSI error counter logs. It tracks detailed error statistics including
 corrected and uncorrected errors across read, write, and verify operations.

 The check provides both absolute error counts and normalized error rates
 per terabyte of data processed, allowing for comprehensive storage health
 monitoring and trend analysis.

 This check requires the {smartmontools} package to be installed on the
 monitored host. The agent plugin uses {smartctl} to collect error counter
 data from storage devices.

 The plugin automatically discovers devices that support SCSI error counter
 logs (typically enterprise SATA/SAS drives and many enterprise SSDs).
 Consumer SSDs and USB drives often do not support this feature and will
 not be monitored.

 Each operation type (read, write, verify) generates detailed metrics:
 errors corrected by ECC fast/delayed, errors corrected by rereads/rewrites,
 total corrected errors, correction algorithm invocations, bytes processed,
 and total uncorrected errors.

item:
 The device path (e.g. {/dev/sda})

discovery:
 One service is created for each storage device that supports SCSI error
 counter logs and has meaningful error counter data available. Services
 are named "SMART Errors <device_path>" (e.g. "SMART Errors /dev/sda").
